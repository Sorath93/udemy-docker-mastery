docker swarm init --advertise-addr <my-ip>

docker-machine create host1
I need to add more to host1 using the join token

docker swarm init --advertise-addr <my-ip>
docker network create --driver overlay backend
docker network create --driver overlay frontend

docker service create --name vote --network frontend --replicas=2 -p 80:80 bretfisher/examplevotingapp_vote
docker service create --name redis --network frontend redis:3.2
docker service create --name worker --network frontend bretfisher/examplevotingapp_worker:java
docker network connect backend worker.1.du4oa1wzb5onw3qq50mv28zwi
docker service create --name db --network backend -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust --mount type=volume,source=db-data,target=/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:9.4
docker service create --name result --network backend -p 5001:80 bretfisher/examplevotingapp_result

Now how do I access the web app on my browser?
  - I did docker-machine ls (in my docker host directory, i.e. my home directory)
   and grabbed the frontend IP. The IP for both host1 and host2 worked.
   I think they both worked because 1) I put host1 and host2 in one swarm and 2) because I created two replicas of vote.
   I should try doing this task again on monday completely from scratch - this time making the swarm first (I did it last before)
   and see what happens if we only have one replica of vote - I think only the host1 IP will work when viewing it.
I should also make note of what has happened - see if you can make a visual diagram?
Try and hone some understanding of services, swarm and networks before moving to the next section.
